Rocq Long Term Roadmap
======================

### Vision: 

The Rocq Development Team, building on 40 years of experience with Coq, is pleased to announce the Rocq Prover, the next-generation proof assistant. The Rocq Prover is designed to empower a diverse range of users, from mathematicians seeking formal rigor to software engineers building high-assurance systems.

While Rocq leverages the rich heritage of Coq, it aims to keep evolving: deliver impactful changes, enable new research and improve the user experience.

This roadmap outlines our vision for Rocq's future, focusing on four key pillars:

+ **Open and Accessible**: The Rocq Prover provides user-friendly installation, comprehensive educational resources, and a thriving community to ensure everyone can benefit from its power.
+ **Trustworthy**: The Rocq Prover prioritizes self-verification and performance optimization, ensuring the highest level of trust and efficiency in your formal proofs.
+ **Maintainable**: We are committed to a clean and streamlined codebase, simplifying future development and reducing the burden on users.
+ **Usable**: We will explore AI-powered features, streamlined domain-specific tools, and do our best to improve day-to-day usability for mathematicians, educators, and engineers alike.

*Join us in shaping the future of formal verification!*

### Target Audiences:

*A,B,C,D,E are used hereafter to refer to the target audiences of each feature, references are given at the end of this roadmap.*

* **(A) Math Education**: The Rocq Prover is a great tool for improving mathematical writing skills. Machine-checking mathematics can even become an addictive serious game. 
* **(B) Computer Science Education**: The Rocq Prover is used worldwide to teach software foundations and program verification, both in academia and in the industry. 
* **(C) Computer Engineering**: Software developers use the Rocq Prover for producing high-assurance code embedded in critical components (*e.g,.* [BedRock System](https://bedrocksystems.com/) and [Formal Vindication](https://formalv.com/)).
* **(D) Researchers in Computer Science**: Academics explore novel applications, usage and extensions of the Rocq Prover. 
* **(E) And beyond**: The Rocq Prover is used as a research instrument in a wide range of domains including fundamental mathematics, computer algebra, robotics, cryptography, hardware design, etc. 

### 1. Open and Accessible

* **Accessibilty:** The Rocq/Coq Platform delivers easy installation and package integration. We are also actively working on IDE improvements for the various usages of the Rocq Prover.


* **Documentation:** We strive to document best practices, tools, and packages, so as to enhance usability for newcomers and experienced users alike (all audiences).

* **Community:** Meet us at the CoqPL, Coq Workshops, and CUDW meetings! We will also continue fostering a strong and collaborative community through initiatives like rocq/coq-community (all audiences).

### 2. Trustworthy Proofs

* **Certified Type Theory and Extraction:** The Rocq prover is based on the formal verification of its type theory implementation and extraction system, minimizing the trusted code base and increasing user confidence in results (C, D, E).
* **Performance Optimization:** We keep identifying areas for performance improvement while maintaining stability (all audiences). 

### 3. Implementation Efficiency and Maintainability

* **Codebase Consolidation:** We are planning to streamline the codebase by selecting the best solutions from various experiments already implemented in the Coq proof assistant, *e.g.,* unification algorithms, tactic sets, overloading mechanisms, universe handling mechanisms, and function definition methods. This goal is to reduce duplication and simplify user experience (all audiences).
* **Ltac2 Transition:** Our proof assistant provides a lightweight language for automating small proving tasks (Ltac).  Experience showed that this language is becoming a power tool. We provide a more principled version (Ltac2) and facilitate a smooth transition from Ltac to Ltac2 for improved extensibility (all audiences).
* **Agile Backward Compatibility:** We prioritize user support and documentation for evolving features without committing to full backward compatibility, taming the burden of adapting older developments but at the time allowing for major innovations (all audiences).
* **API Stability:** We ensure stable APIs for external tools like automation frameworks, interfaces, and plugins (C, D).

### 4. Enhanced Usability

* **AI-powered Features:** Leverage AI for improved suggestion mechanisms, proof search, information retrieval, error reporting, and visualization (A, B, C, E).
* **Theory Transfer Support:** Develop tools for transferring proofs and concepts between different representations, *e.g.*, proof-oriented vs. computation-oriented structures (D, E).
* **Library Integration:** Simplify collaboration and integration of existing and future libraries from diverse contributors (C, E).
* **Multi-theory and Logic Support:** Enable support for classical, exceptional, and observational logics within the same system (D, E).
* **Domain-Specific Customization:** Provide user interface adaptations for efficient use in specific domains like education and engineering (A, B, C). 
* **Metaprogramming support:** Multiple platforms for metaprogramming tactics and terms manipulations (Ltac2, Elpi, MetaCoq) (C, D, E)
* **Educational Resources:** Develop tutorials and documentation highlighting features that save time and improve workflow (A, B, C).
* **Improved Notation and Structuring Mechanisms:** Improve the notation system and structuring tools such as Hierarchy Builder (all audiences).

* **Balancing Generality with Domain Specificity:**  Maintain a general framework with core libraries while simultaneously supporting domain-specific libraries (*e.g.,* Iris) (all audience).


**_This roadmap represents our ongoing commitment to making the Rocq Prover a powerful, user-friendly, and reliable proof assistant for a broad range of users. We welcome feedback and contributions from the community to help us achieve this vision._**
