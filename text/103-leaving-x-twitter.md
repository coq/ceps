Title: Transitioning from X/Twitter to new social media platforms
Drivers: Théo Zimmermann (@Zimmi48)

## Summary

This RFC proposes that as part of the actions to be taken in the context of the renaming of Coq to the Rocq Prover, a departure from X/Twitter should be announced and implemented. The rationale for this decision is based on the changing ownership and policy at X/Twitter, the current management of the X/Twitter account, the overall context of many academics and academic institutions leaving X/Twitter, and the opportunity presented by the renaming to move to more appropriate platforms.

## Context and motivation

The decision to leave X/Twitter is motivated by several factors:

1. **Changing ownership and policy at X/Twitter:**
  Since the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, significant policy changes, including in moderation, promotion of misinformation, etc. have caused concern within the scientific and open-source communities. The Coq/Rocq team's values of openness, collaboration, and inclusivity, but also the academic and scientific communities' values, are increasingly at odds with the direction of the platform.

1. **Costs associated with the renaming:**
  Renaming Coq to the Rocq Prover triggers costs, including for the X/Twitter account, which will also need to be renamed. Doing the work of adapting the current CoqLang account to become a Rocq Prover X/Twitter account in the current context would send a political statement that the project does not care about the current direction the platform is taking. Disabling the existing account and stopping all use of X/Twitter is the only reasonable course of action in the context of the renaming.

1. **Diminishing engagement and influence:**
  [X/Twitter's relevance among academics is waning](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/tech-innovation/digital-publishing/2024/11/13/more-academics-flee-x-after-election), with many users and academic institutions (e.g., Aix-Marseille University, University of Strasbourg, University of Luxembourg, RWTH Aachen, Utrecht University, York University) having already left, and migrating to alternatives such as Mastodon and Bluesky. Furthermore, X/Twitter is already banned in Brazil, and an investigation against the platform by the EU commission is ongoing. In this context, staying active on X/Twitter is no longer a good use of community resources.

1. **Current management of the X/Twitter account:**
  The CoqLang account on X/Twitter was initially managed by three people. Out of these people, one has stopped being active in the Coq ecosystem, and I, Théo Zimmermann, have already stopped being active on X/Twitter at the time of Twitter's acquisition by Elon Musk. This means that there is only one person left to manage the account, with an irregular presence. Aiming to preserve the account would require adding more resources to this task, which is not desirable given the context.

## Design

Besides aiming to officially announce a departure from X/Twitter, this RFC proposes to reform the way the Rocq Prover project manages its social media presence, by involving new motivated volunteers.

### Proposed steps

1. **Announce departure from X/Twitter and call for volunteers** (as soon as the decision is approved, and without waiting for the renaming to be finalized) :
   - Publish a final post from the CoqLang account declaring that the project will cease activity on X/Twitter and that we will explore alternative platforms for the Rocq Prover social media presence, depending on community interest and volunteer availability.
   - Supplement the X/Twitter announcement with parallel communications on Discourse, Coq-Club, and team members' personal social media accounts (e.g., Mastodon, LinkedIn).
   - Specify interest in alternative platforms such as Mastodon, Bluesky, and LinkedIn, but clearly state that the list of platforms is not fixed and remains open to community input.
   - Emphasize that these platforms will only be adopted if motivated volunteers step forward to manage them.

2. **Suspend activity and redirect** :
   - After the announcement, cease all activity on X/Twitter, except for possibly updating the profile description to direct followers to new platforms.
   - In particular, the account will not be used anymore to like, retweet, reply, or post new content.

3. **Create new accounts and animate social media team** :
   - Create accounts for the Rocq Prover on alternative platforms as motivated volunteers emerge. The accounts can be created before the Rocq Prover renaming is finalized, but their owners should wait for the new visual identity and the go-ahead from the core team before starting to post.
   - Create a private Zulip channel for coordination between the social media team members.

## Drawbacks

- **Loss of reach and visibility:**
  Leaving X/Twitter may reduce the project's visibility and reach, especially in the short term. However, this is mitigated by the fact that the project's target audience is increasingly moving to other platforms.

- **Risk of confusion between the messages of renaming and leaving X/Twitter:**
  Announcing the departure from X/Twitter at the same time as the renaming may confuse the community. However, the renaming was decided in particular because of the inclusivity issues that the previous name raised, and given the openness values that the project wants to promote, remaining on X/Twitter would be contradictory.

## Alternatives

- **Gradual Transition with Auto-Reposting**
  During a recent Coq Call, an alternative was proposed to maintain the X/Twitter account with auto-reposting from Mastodon and to archive it once the scientific community has largely left X.

  This approach has drawbacks, including: 
     - Continuing implicit endorsement of X/Twitter.
     - Requring to keep managing the account, including renaming it, monitoring replies and DMs.

- **Immediate Archiving Without Announcement**
  Another option is to quietly stop posting on X/Twitter without a formal announcement. However, this could be confusing if the CoqLang account still exists and is never renamed.

## Unresolved questions

- **Which platforms will be chosen for the Rocq Prover social media presence?** This is to be decided after the decision to leave X/Twitter is approved and motivated volunteers step forward.
